Rules to build Postgres from source using rules_foreign_cc.

This module defines the `pg_build` macro, which wraps the [`rules_foreign_cc`
`meson` rule] to build Postgres from source. It sets up the required
environment variables, toolchain references, and Meson options needed for the
build.

        # Meson runfiles dir when running tools from Meson and Bison can't find
        # some of its data files.

        # Looking at the rules_foreign_cc wrapper script:
