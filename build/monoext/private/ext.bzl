    The external test model mirrors PostgreSQL core: an extension's test
    universe is DISCOVERED, not hand-transcribed. Each ext version ships a
    committed `introspect/<ext>~<ver>.json` (produced by the build's `make -n
    installcheck` dry run; see `tools/ext_introspect.py`) naming its regress
    suite, its TAP `.pl` files, and its installed `*.control` names. This reads
    those per-version introspects (cheap committed reads, no source fetch, so
    the hub stays lazy) and folds the catalog `repo.json` customizations on top,
    producing the same `test_ext` shape (`{smoke, test:
    {version_spec: {slug: decl}}}`) the hub renderer already consumes.

    The discovered suites are keyed by each version's own `compatible_with`
    spec, so the correct suite resolves per base version. The
    `metadata.test_ext` in `repo.json` now carries only what discovery cannot
    know:

    - `smoke`: `preload` / `cascade` (the discovered `extensions` default to
      the installed `*.control` names, and may be overridden here).
    - `test_overrides`: `{slug: {locale, exclusive, temp_config, temp_instance,
      encoding, dbname, load_extensions, exclude, exclude_tests}}`, folded onto
      the discovered decl for that slug (`exclude` drops the suite;
      `exclude_tests` drops individual test / `.pl` names, either as a flat list
      or a version-spec-keyed map resolved per base version).
    - `test`: `{version_spec: {slug: decl}}` custom suites (integration or
      manual) that no `installcheck` can produce, merged on top of the
      discovered ones.
    - `requires`: `[ext_name, ...]` prerequisite catalog extensions whose
      artifact + runtime-deps trees are overlaid into every test instance for
      this extension (e.g. pgrouting requires postgis for `CREATE EXTENSION`).

    Returns `(test_ext, introspect_versions)`: the untouched `metadata.test_ext`
    and an empty version list when the extension ships no introspects yet, so
    extensions migrate onto discovery one at a time by committing their
    `introspect/` files.
