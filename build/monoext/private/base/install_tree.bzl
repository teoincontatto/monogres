"""`pg_install_tree`: assemble the native Postgres install tree.

It assembles a directory of REAL files laid out under bin/ lib/ share/ (the
prefix_distro layout), the same shape the regress harness consumes. It is a
single tree artifact, the same output shape the make flavor's `_install_tree`
produces, so the harness reaches it through its directory-tree path
(`bin/initdb` under the tree root) identically to either upstream build.

The files are copied, not symlinked, because Postgres relocates at run time by
resolving its own executable path (`find_my_exec` follows every symlink) and
deriving sharedir / libdir relative to the `.../bin/<exe>` it lands on. A
symlinked `bin/postgres` resolves out to the scattered cc_binary output (whose
parent is not `bin/`), relocation fails, and the backend falls back to the
compiled-in `/postgres/<version>/share`. A real file under `bin/` keeps
relocation working with no `-L` / `PGSHAREDIR` from the harness.

The copy runs as one hermetic `run_shell` action (busybox `cp` / `ln` / `mkdir`,
no archiver or python), driven by a written manifest so it scales to the whole
tree without a giant command line. libpq's soname / dev links (libpq.so.5 ->
libpq.so.5.16) are emitted as relative symlinks inside the tree, the way an
install creates them.
"""

# One hermetic copy action lays the whole tree out from a manifest. Each line is
# tab-separated `<kind>\t<a>\t<b>`: `F` copies the real file at exec-relative
# path <a> to tree-relative <b>; `L` makes the relative symlink <a> -> <b>
# inside the tree (libpq's soname / dev links). `cp -L` dereferences so the tree
# holds real content even when Bazel stages an input as a symlink.
#
# An optional `base` tree is laid down first (`cp -a`, preserving the base's own
# real files and within-tree symlinks), then this tree's manifest overlays it.
# That composes a layer (e.g. `:tar.test` over the production `:tar`) the way an
# OCI image stacks layers, without duplicating the base's file list.
#
# An optional `exclude` list then carves paths back out of the composed tree
# (shell-globbed `rm -rf`), so a runtime subset can be derived from a full base:
# `:tar` drops the dev-only paths (headers, pgxs, pkg-config, static archives)
# the meson `:tar.dev` keeps.
#
# `exclude_paths` carves the same way but from a manifest of literal paths, for
# the carve no glob can express: contrib and the procedural languages install
# into `lib/` and `share/extension/` right beside the backend's own modules and
# plpgsql, so the only thing separating them is the introspection's per-file
# attribution. Emptied parent directories are walked back off the tree too --
# `share/doc/extension/` holds nothing but contrib, and an empty directory in
# the runtime still says the extension is there.
