OpenHalo build options.

OpenHalo is a PG 14.18 fork (HaloTech-Co-Ltd/openHalo) that adds MySQL wire-
protocol + dialect compatibility. The MySQL adapter is inline in
`src/backend/adapter/mysql/` and the helper extension `aux_mysql` is shipped in
upstream `contrib/`, so the source tree is self-contained — no sibling tarball
or `extra_sources` are needed.

OpenHalo ships only an autoconf+make build path; this flavor uses
`pg_build_make` (the make wrapper) and the option vocabulary defined by
`pg.bzl`, with three post-merge adjustments:

- `prefix_distro = "/openhalo/<version>"` — embedded in `pg_config.h` via
  `--prefix` (the autoconf+make build does not have a separate `prefix_distro`
  option; `--prefix` is the embedded runtime path, while `make install
  DESTDIR=...` controls the install staging location independently).
- `uuid = "ossp"` (when `uuid` is in the merged options) — OpenHalo's upstream
  README documents `--with-uuid=ossp` as mandatory. The override is conditional
  so option sets that omit `uuid` (e.g. `barebones`) are not affected.
- `zstd` is dropped from the merged options. PG 14 has no `--with-zstd` flag
  (added in PG 15); `to_configure_args` enumerates the full known boolean option
  set and emits `--without-X` for any option absent from the merged dict, so
  popping `zstd` here yields `--without-zstd` at configure time — which
  OpenHalo's autoconf surfaces as a benign unrecognized-option warning, whereas
  leaving `zstd = "enabled"` in `regular`/`full` would emit `--with-zstd` and
  fail. Per-option compat gating via `metadata.build_options.compatible` does
  not cover this case: `zstd` is in `pg.bzl::_OPTION_SETS_REGULAR` directly, and
  the compat check in `helpers.compute()` only runs against
  `_DISABLED_UNLESS_EXPLICITLY_ENABLED` / `_ENABLED_UNLESS_EXPLICITLY_DISABLED`.

    Computes OpenHalo build options and auto-feature settings.

    Delegates to `pg.bzl` (option vocabulary is identical) and applies three
    OpenHalo-specific adjustments: drop PG-14-incompatible options (currently
    `zstd`), inject `prefix_distro = "/openhalo/<version>"`, and inject `uuid =
    "ossp"` when `uuid` is already in the resolved options (barebones-style sets
    that omit it are left unchanged).

    Args:
        version (string): OpenHalo version (e.g. "1.0").
        option_set (string): One of the predefined build option sets (e.g.
            "barebones", "full", etc).
        build_options_metadata (dict): A dictionary mapping build options to
            their compatible OpenHalo version constraints spec.
        debug (bool): If `True`, prints debug messages when build options are
            incompatible with the given OpenHalo version.

    Returns:
        (options, auto_features)
