"""
Babelfish for PostgreSQL build options.

Babelfish for PostgreSQL ships a fork of PostgreSQL
(`postgresql_modified_for_babelfish`) plus five PGXS extensions
(`babelfishpg_{tsql,tds,common,money,unit}`) under a separate repository
(`babelfish_extensions`); the extensions live under `contrib/<ext>/` and are
compiled together with PostgreSQL's standard contribs as part of the merged
source tree (see `catalog/babelfish/repo.json` `extra_sources`).

The Babelfish project ships an autoconf+make build path; the contrib Makefiles
have no Meson counterpart, so this flavor uses `pg_build_make` (autoconf-based)
rather than `pg_build` (Meson-based). The option vocabulary still mirrors
`pg.bzl` — the values are translated to autoconf flags by
`configure_args.bzl::to_configure_args` at build time.

This module wraps `pg.bzl::build_options` and applies two post-merge overrides:

- `prefix_distro = "/babelfish/<version>"` — embedded in `pg_config.h` via
  `--prefix` (the autoconf+make build does not have a separate `prefix_distro`
  option; `--prefix` is the embedded runtime path, while `make install
  DESTDIR=...` controls the install staging location independently).
- `uuid = "ossp"` (when `uuid` is in the merged options) — Babelfish documents
  `--with-uuid=ossp` in `INSTALL.md`. The override is conditional so option sets
  that omit `uuid` (e.g. `barebones`) are not affected.
