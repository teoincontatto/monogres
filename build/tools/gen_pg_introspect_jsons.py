"""
Generate maximally-idempotent introspect JSONs for a monogres flavor hub
(`@pg`, `@ivory`, …); instantiated once per flavor in `//build/tools:BUILD.bazel`.

Usage
-----

    bazel run //build/tools:gen_pg_introspect_jsons

The build target wires every `@<hub>//<v>/<os>:introspect` (manual) target as a
data dependency, so `bazel run` builds the inputs as a prerequisite before
executing this script. Outputs are written back to the source tree under
`build/catalog/<flavor>/introspect/`: the production introspect as
`<flavor>~<v>~<os>.json`, and the test-enabled build variant
(tap_tests/injection_points on) as `<flavor>~<v>~<os>+test.json`. The script
uses the `BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY` env var that Bazel sets when running via
`bazel run` (see `build/tools/gen_index.bzl` for the same pattern).

Why this script exists
----------------------

Postgres' Meson build emits a JSON describing the configured build (compilers,
buildoptions, targets, install plan, etc.). We check those JSONs into the
catalog so the rest of the build/test pipeline can reason about per-version
features without re-running Meson. The raw Meson output contains many tokens
that are stable for a *given build* but vary across builds, machines, archs,
sandboxes, and tool/dependency version bumps — checking them in unmodified
would produce a noisy git history every time anything changes.

This script normalizes those tokens so the checked-in JSONs are byte-stable
under any change that doesn't actually affect the introspected build state.

What we normalize
-----------------

The substitutions are applied in order (see `SUBSTITUTIONS` below). Outer
placeholders are inserted before inner patterns can depend on them.

  1. **Bazel cache root** — `~/.cache/bazel/_bazel_<user>/<hash>` on the host
     and `/cache/bazel-cache/...` in the Docker sandbox both collapse to
     `<BAZEL_CACHE>`.

  2. **Bazel sandbox / execroot** — sandboxes have ephemeral numeric suffixes
     (`linux-sandbox/12345/execroot/_main`); we replace the variable bit
     with `<SANDBOX>/<BAZEL-BUILD>`. Outside a sandbox, the path is just
     `execroot/_main`, which becomes `<BAZEL-BUILD>`.

  3. **Bzlmod canonical names** — Bazel mangles external repo names based on
     the module graph (`+monoext+pg`, `monogres++monoext+pg`,
     `+_repo_rules+pg_src`, `+monoext+pg_src-17.4`, …). We collapse both PG
     source repo shapes (`+pg_src` and `+pg_src-<v>`) to `<PG_SRC>` and the
     hub itself to `<PG_HUB>`. The PG_SRC rule must come *before* PG_HUB
     because `+pg_src` also matches the `+pg` suffix.

  4. **Bazel exec-config / mnemonic digests** — paths like
     `bazel-out/k8-opt-exec-ST-d57f47055a04/bin/external/.../__cfg00000000/`
     embed two hashes Bazel derives from the configuration graph. They are
     stable today but the algorithm has changed in past Bazel releases, so
     we normalize them defensively.

  5. **Architecture** — CPU (`aarch64` / `x86_64` / `k8`) → `<CPU>`; the
     Debian/dpkg arch (`amd64` / `arm64`) → `<ARCH>`.

  6. **Tool versions** — Python, TCL, bison, flex, LLVM versions appear in
     paths like `python_3_11_*-unknown-linux-gnu`, `libpython3.11.so`,
     `tcl8.6`, `bison_v3.3.2__cfg...`, `llvm-ar-14`. We use generic numeric
     patterns (e.g. `[0-9]+_[0-9]+`) so the rules stay valid when MODULE.bazel
     bumps any of these toolchains — no second source of truth to keep in
     sync.

  7. **PG version** — the literal version string (e.g. `17.4`) anywhere in
     the JSON becomes `<PG_VERSION>`. Done via `content.replace()` rather
     than regex because the version is known at processing time.

  8. **PG target name** — `postgres~<v>~<option_set>` (the per-build Bazel
     target name) becomes `<PG_TARGET>`. This rule was accidentally dropped
     in refactor `3f04bf30` while the rest of the script was updated for
     the @pg hub; we restore it here.

  9. **Meson internal IDs** — see the dedicated section below.

 10. **Meson anonymous-dependency names** — Meson auto-names anonymous
     dependency objects with `f'dep{id(self)}'` (see
     `mesonbuild/dependencies/base.py:109`). `id()` is the Python object's
     memory address, so these change every single Meson run. We re-number
     them by first-seen order to `<MESON_DEP_NNNN>`.

 11. **String-array fields with set-derived order** — `exclude_files` /
     `exclude_dirs` in `install_subdirs`, `depends` / `dependencies` in
     `targets` / `tests` / `benchmarks`. Meson populates these from sets
     or `os.listdir()`, so the *contents* are stable but the *order*
     isn't. We sort each such array lexicographically (after the ID
     normalizations, so the sort key is the stable placeholder, not the
     volatile underlying hex).

 12. **Colon-separated path-list env vars** — `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PATH`,
     `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` in test/benchmark env blocks. Meson builds these
     via `':'.join(list(set_of_paths))` (see
     `mesonbuild/backend/backends.py:1266-1278`); the join order is
     `PYTHONHASHSEED`-randomized. We split on `:`, deduplicate, and
     sort. Single-path values (no `:`) pass through unchanged — they can
     still vary across runs for reasons upstream of the `:`-join but
     there's no sort key for one element.

 13. **pkgconfig dependency versions** — every entry in the top-level
     `dependencies` array records the `version` of the system library
     Meson found (icu `76.1`, openssl `3.5.1`, …). These are
     release-derived and not consumed by the build, so we replace each
     with a `<PKGCONFIG_<NAME>>` placeholder whose token is derived from
     the dependency's own `name`. Deriving the token from the JSON means a
     dependency added or bumped by a future PG or Debian release is
     covered with no new rule. Entries already carrying a placeholder
     version (the `python-<PY_VERSION>-embed` and `LLVM` deps, normalized
     by the substitution rules above) are left untouched.

 14. **List-of-dict array order** — `buildoptions`, the `dependencies`
     metadata array, and `targets` are emitted in Meson's internal order,
     which reshuffles across Meson versions (and, for `targets`, across
     any build-graph change). Consumers look these up by field value
     (`buildoptions` by `name`, `targets` by `name`/`id`; the dependency
     array is not read), never by position, so we sort each by a stable
     per-element key (`name`, or `id` for targets).

Meson target IDs (and our `<MESON_SUBDIR_NNNN>` placeholders)
-------------------------------------------------------------

In Meson terminology these are **target IDs**. A "target" is the canonical
word for a buildable thing — every Meson `Target` subclass (`Executable`,
`StaticLibrary`, `SharedLibrary`, `CustomTarget`, `RunTarget`, …) inherits
a `get_id()` method that returns:

    <7-hex>@@<name>@<3-letter-type>

The "target" concept maps cleanly across build systems:

    Meson      target              get_id() -> <hash>@@<name>@<type>
    CMake      target              add_executable, add_library, add_custom_target
    Bazel      label / rule        //path:name
    Ninja      build edge          build out: rule in
    Make       rule                target: deps  /  recipe
    Gradle     task                project:task

(Ninja is Meson's actual backend, so Meson targets ultimately compile down
to Ninja build edges.)

Decomposition of the three parts:

  - `<7-hex>` — Meson's source comments call this `parent_name_hash`; in
    this script we call it the **subdir slug**. It is
    `hashlib.sha256(subdir.encode('utf-8'))[:7]`, where `subdir` is the
    source directory containing the target, relative to the Meson project
    root. Multiple targets defined in the same `meson.build` share this
    prefix.

  - `<name>` — the user-facing target name from the corresponding
    `meson.build` call. Forward and backward slashes in names are
    replaced by `@`.

        executable('psql', sources, ...)        -> name = 'psql'
        library('libpgcommon', sources, ...)    -> name = 'libpgcommon'
        custom_target('expand-dat-files', ...)  -> name = 'expand-dat-files'

  - `<3-letter-type>` — the kind suffix, returned by
    `Target.type_suffix()` on the concrete subclass:

        exe = Executable       sta = StaticLibrary    sha = SharedLibrary
        cus = CustomTarget     run = RunTarget

    (Meson has more obscure variants like `Jar` / `BothLibraries`; we
    haven't observed those in PG introspect output.)

See `mesonbuild/build.py:605-631` (`Target._get_id_hash` +
`Target.construct_id_from_path`) for the canonical algorithm.

The subdir slug exists *only* to disambiguate the case where the same
`<name>@<type>` appears in multiple subdirs (in our build: 9 such pairs
out of ~944 — `autoinc@sha`, `refint@sha`, `gram@cus`, `define.c@cus`,
`describe@exe`, `sqlda.c@cus`, etc., because PG defines those test/regress
helpers in multiple directories). For the remaining ~935 unique
`<name>@<type>` pairs the slug carries no information.

The slug is deterministic for a given checkout (same `subdir` always →
same `sha256(subdir)[:7]`), but it is volatile across **Meson upgrades** —
if a future Meson version tweaks how `subdir` is normalized before hashing
(encoding, separator handling, …) every ID would shift, producing a
massive but semantically empty diff.

To make target IDs idempotent we normalize per `(name, type)` group:

  1. Find all `<7-hex>@@<name>@<type>` matches in the file.
  2. Group by `(name, type)`.
  3. Within each group, sort the distinct slugs lexicographically.
  4. Replace each slug with `<MESON_SUBDIR_NNNN>` (1-based, 4-digit
     zero-padded).

So `<MESON_SUBDIR_0001>@@<name>@<type>` means "the first (sorted) source
subdirectory that owns a target called `<name>@<type>` in this JSON". The
placeholder name reflects the *semantics* (a subdir slug), not the
original format (a 7-hex string).

This is stable as long as the SET of subdirs containing target
`<name>@<type>` doesn't change — adding or removing targets in *unrelated*
subdirs has no effect on this group's numbering.

Tradeoffs:

  - **Locally stable**: changes to subdir X only shift indexes in the
    `(name, type)` groups that subdir X owns; other groups untouched.
  - **No "same slug means same subdir" signal preserved across groups**:
    if subdir-slug `cae59eb` owns both `autoinc@sha` (group A) and
    `refint@sha` (group B), it gets index 1 in both groups by coincidence
    of sort order, not by design. This is fine because the meaningful
    identifier is the `(name, type)` pair; the placeholder index only
    disambiguates within the group.
  - **Idempotent**: re-running on already-normalized output is a no-op,
    since `MESON_SUBDIR_NNNN` is 4 digits + underscores (not 7-hex).

    so it sits beside its production sibling.

    Top-level by necessity — `ProcessPoolExecutor` workers pickle the
    function by qualified name.

    Returns `(output_path, error_or_None)`. Errors are returned (not
    raised) so a failure in one file doesn't tear down the pool, and so
    the driver can surface every failure in a single end-of-run report.
